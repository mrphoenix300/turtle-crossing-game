# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A simple Python game built using the **Turtle Graphics** module.  
The player controls a turtle trying to cross a road full of moving cars —  
each time it reaches the top, the level increases and the cars move faster.

## 🎮 Features

- Player movement using the **Up arrow** key  
- Randomly spawned cars with different colors and speeds  
- Increasing difficulty with every level  
- “Game Over” screen when a collision occurs

## 🧠 Learning Purpose

This project was created as part of my learning journey in **Python** and  
specifically to practice **object-oriented programming** and the **turtle** library.  
It helped me understand:

- Class design and inheritance  
- Basic collision detection  
- Game loop timing with `time.sleep()` and `screen.update()`
